Description: Install server
 Cobbler is a network install server.  Cobbler
 supports PXE, virtualized installs, and
 reinstalling existing Linux machines.  The last two
 modes use a helper tool, 'koan', that
 integrates with cobbler.  Cobbler's advanced features
 include importing distributions from DVDs and rsync
 mirrors, kickstart templating, integrated yum
 mirroring, and built-in DHCP/DNS Management.  Cobbler has
 a Python and XMLRPC API for integration with other
 applications.  There is also a web interface.
